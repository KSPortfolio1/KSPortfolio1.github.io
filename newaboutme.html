    <h2>Digital Humanities</h2>
    
<hr>
<p>
My specialization in digital humanities allowed me to gain valuable skills. Through my specialization I had the opportunity to take the course Advanced Software: Intro to Web Design. 
This course gave me the knowledge to use both HTML/CSS to code this portfolio website, learn principles of accessibility, and to create a website plan from start to finish.

<h2>Environmental Humanities</h2>

<hr>
<p>
I decided to specialize in Environmental Humanities after taking a Caribbean literature class. 
This class empahsized the importance of thinking about how culture can change how environmental issues
are addressed. I think it is very important to look to the people from a place when talking about the 
environmental issues occuring there to get clearer understanding of the issues at hand. We also talk
about the importance of understanding how places will all 
experience the consequences of something like climate change differently.
