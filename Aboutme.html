<h1>About me</h1>
<hr>
<p>
I am an Senior English major with Specializations in Digital and Environmental Humanities. I am also an aspiring web designer. 
I have found that being an English major has allowed me to work on a variety of skills including comminicating to a variety of different kinds of audiences
and managing my time well. My hobbies include reading, writing, paddleboarding, and enjoying the outdoors.

    <h2>Digital Humanities</h2>
    
<hr>
<p>
Specializing in digital humanities has allowed me to take courses like 
Studies in Textuality and New Media, Data Science for the Humanities, and Web Design. 
Classes like these have allowed me to gain many new skills including learning how to code with HTML/CSS and Python. 
I have also gained a better understanding of how my communication and plannning skills can apply to many different circumstances.

<h2>Environmental Humanities</h2>

<hr>
<p>
I decided to specialize in Environmental Humanities after taking a Caribbean literature class. 
This class empahsized the importance of thinking about how culture can change how environmental issues
are addressed. I think it is very important to look to the people from a place when talking about the 
environmental issues occuring there to get clearer understanding of the issues at hand. We also talk
about the importance of understanding how places will all 
experience the consequences of something like climate change differently.
